A plugin which transforms Bukkit into a no-nonsense Vanilla-like server, with all the optimizations of Bukkit but without those pesky plugins and other additions.

### What does that mean, "no-nonsense"?

Well, for you, that means that we are "fixing" parts of Bukkit to make the functionality exactly like Vanilla.

### What does "functionality exactly like Vanilla" mean?

I'm so glad you asked. :)

Here are a few things we're changing up:

 - Command Functionality
   - Permissions
   - Implementation
   - /help
   - Command Block Systems
 - Plugins
   - Disable everything but us.
 - Query
   - Respond with the latest standard vanilla Minecraft information plus our online information.
 - And other various changes.
 
### So when will this be done?

Probably never.

### Can I assist?

Sure! Fork, fix, and pull request your way to victory!

### Why would you do this?!!?!

Because we're interested in the _vanilla_ functionality, but we want servers run on low budgets (or perhaps on tight hardware limitations) to run smoothly and effectively.

### Licensing

We are licensed under GPL 3.0+, as seen in the LICENSE file. Upon making forks or using this software, make sure to include the GPL license and adhere to it in all ways specified by the GPL.

### How do I get more information about Templex?

Well, look around this organization, for one. If you're too lazy (or just looking to join the server), go [to our website](http://templex.ddns.net/).
